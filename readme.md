<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This guide helps you setup datahutt's SRTLA docker container. Opening ports on your router, setting up NOALBS and Other programs is up to you.

Thanks to datagutt for making this container https://github.com/datagutt/bbox-receiver

I made a webpage you open locally on your own browser to generate the docker command and stream urls to save you time. Plug in the values then press generate.
